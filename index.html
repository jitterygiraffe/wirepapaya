        <div class="abt-txt">
        <p>We are a small, woman-owned design studio. 
            We love creating beautiful, 
            functional,and thoughtfully-designed 
            stationery that brings joy and inspiration 
            to your everyday life.</p>
        <p>
            We illustrate, print, cut, 
            and bind each item ourselves, 
            with our own hands. 
            When you purchase our prints and stationery, 
            you're contributing to a sustainable, 
            artisanal approach to design.
